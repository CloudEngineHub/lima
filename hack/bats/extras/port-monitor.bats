# This test verifies that when a container is destroyed, its ports can be reused
# immediately and are not subject to being freed by a polling loop. See #4066.

# This test should not be run in CI as it is not totally reliable: there is always a chance that the server will
# take longer to actually respond to requests after opening the port. The test works around it by retrying once
# on curl exit code 52, but have been observed at least once to fail by refusing to connect.
