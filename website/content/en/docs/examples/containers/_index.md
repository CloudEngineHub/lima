Lima was designed to facilitate running containers inside a virtual machine, with automatic
[filesystem sharing](../../config/mount.md) and  [port forwarding](../../config/port.md).

The original motivation of Lima was to promote [containerd](./containerd) for macOS users, however,
the current version of Lima supports other container engines too, and does not depend on macOS hosts.
