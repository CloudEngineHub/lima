 | ‚ö° Requirement | Lima >= 2.0 |
 |----------------|-------------|

Lima supports two types of drivers: **internal** and **external**. This architecture allows for extensibility and platform-specific implementations. Drivers are unware whether they are internal or external.

> **üí° See also**: [VM Types](../../config/vmtype) for user configuration of different virtualization backends.


## Internal vs External Drivers

**Internal Drivers** are compiled directly into the `limactl` binary and are registered automatically at startup by passing the driver object into `registry.Register()` function and importing the package in the main limactl code using Go's blank import `_`. For example:
- **qemu:** [registration file](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/blob/master/pkg/driver/qemu/register.go) & [import file](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/blob/master/cmd/limactl/main_qemu.go)

Build tags control which drivers are compiled as internal vs external (e.g., `external_qemu`, `external_vz`, `external_wsl2`).

**External Drivers** are separate executables that communicate with Lima via gRPC. They are discovered at runtime from configured directories.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: External drivers are experimental and the API may change in future releases.

## Building Drivers as External

You can build existing internal drivers as external drivers using the `ADDITIONAL_DRIVERS` Makefile variable:

```bash
# Build QEMU as external driver
make ADDITIONAL_DRIVERS=qemu limactl additional-drivers

# Build multiple drivers as external  
make ADDITIONAL_DRIVERS="qemu vz wsl2" limactl additional-drivers
```

This creates external driver binaries in `_output/libexec/lima/` with the naming pattern `lima-driver-<name>` (or `lima-driver-<name>.exe` on Windows).

## Driver Discovery

Lima discovers external drivers from these locations:

1. **Custom directories**: Set path to the external driver's directory via `LIMA_DRIVERS_PATH` environment variable
2. **Standard directory**: `<LIMA-PREFIX>/libexec/lima/`, where `<LIMA_PREFIX>` is the location path where the Lima binary is present

The discovery process is handled by [`pkg/registry/registry.go`.](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/blob/master/pkg/registry/registry.go)

## Creating Custom External Drivers

To create a new external driver:

1. **Implement the interface**: Your driver must implement the [`driver.Driver`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lima-vm/lima/v2/pkg/driver#Driver) interface:

```go
type Driver interface {
	Lifecycle
	GUI
	SnapshotManager
	GuestAgent

	Info() Info
	Configure(inst *limatype.Instance) *ConfiguredDriver
	FillConfig(ctx context.Context, cfg *limatype.LimaYAML, filePath string) error
	SSHAddress(ctx context.Context) (string, error)
}
```

2. **Create main.go**: Use [`server.Serve()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lima-vm/lima/v2/pkg/driver/external/server#Serve) to expose your driver:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "github.com/lima-vm/lima/v2/pkg/driver/external/server"
)

func main() {
    driver := &MyDriver{}
    server.Serve(context.Background(), driver)
}
```

3. **Build and deploy**: 
   - Build your driver: `go build -o lima-driver-mydriver main.go`
   - Place the binary in a directory accessible via `LIMA_DRIVERS_PATH`
   - Ensure the binary is executable

4. **Use the driver**: Explicitly specify the driver when creating instances:

```bash
limactl create myinstance --vm-type=mydriver template://default
```

## Examples
