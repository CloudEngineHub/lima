> **Warning**
> "wsl2" mode is experimental

| âš¡ Requirement | Lima >= 0.18 + (Windows >= 10 Build 19041 OR Windows 11) |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |

"wsl2" option makes use of native virtualization support provided by Windows' `wsl.exe` ([more info](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)).

An example configuration:
{{< tabpane text=true >}}
{{% tab header="CLI" %}}
```bash
limactl start --vm-type=wsl2 --mount-type=wsl2 --containerd=system
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab header="YAML" %}}
```yaml
# Example to run Fedora using vmType: wsl2

### Caveats
- "wsl2" option is only supported on newer versions of Windows (roughly anything since 2019)

### Known Issues
- "wsl2" currently doesn't support many of Lima's options. See [this file](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/blob/master/pkg/wsl2/wsl_driver_windows.go#L19) for the latest supported options.
- When running lima using "wsl2", `${LIMA_HOME}/<INSTANCE>/serial.log` will not contain kernel boot logs
- WSL2 requires a `tar` formatted rootfs archive instead of a VM image
- Windows doesn't ship with ssh.exe, gzip.exe, etc. which are used by Lima at various points. The easiest way around this is to run `winget install -e --id Git.MinGit` (winget is now built in to Windows as well), and add the resulting `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\` directory to your path.
