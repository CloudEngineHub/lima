cpuType:
  # When emulating Intel on ARM hosts, Lima uses the "qemu64" CPU by default (https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/pull/494).
  # However, CentOS Stream 10 kernel reboots indefinitely due to lack of the support for x86_64-v3 instructions.
  # This issue is tracked in <https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/issues/3063>.
