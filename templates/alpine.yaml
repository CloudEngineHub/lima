# The built-in containerd installer does not support Alpine currently.
# Use a provisioning script to install containerd, buildkit, and nerdctl.
#
# NOTE: Starting with Lima v2.0, nerdctl version must be v2.1.6 or later to
# enable port forwarding in rootful mode.
# As of the time of releasing Lima v2.0, nerdctl v2.1.6 or later is not yet
# available in the official Alpine package repository (`apk add`).
# See <https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl/releases> for installing
# the latest version of nerdctl from the binary or the source.
